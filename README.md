# Documentation of the modelized of the Yagi-Uda Antenna
The documentation file are writed with the markdown language
# Branch description
# File description
We can share here the specificity of each file (Description of the tree and the files)
# Parameters
This section are dedicated for the result of our simulation (Optimized Reflectivity ($S(1,1)$) Gain, Directivity, etc....)
## Theoric result
## Equivalent circuit
# Roadmap
1. Choose the right dimension of the Antenna
2. Make the 3D modelisation
3. Try to optimize the different parameters at their max (S(1,1), directivity, Gain, etc ...) with the length of the antenna
4. Try to find a balanced compromise for all parameters - find the appropriate length
5. Give the value of your electrical component by explaining the deduction
